# Analysis-Software-for-Freeze-thaw-cycles-induce-content-exchange-between-cell-sized-lipid-vesicles

The code deposited here is the version used in the paper Litschel et al., New Journal of Physics 2018, “Freeze-thaw cycles induce content exchange between cell-sized lipid vesicles” (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aabb96). The main script (FT_data_analysis) analyses the data using fucntions from the folder 'source code', saves the results as matlab variables and produces some diagnostic plots. The scripts under "Code for generating plots" were used to generate the plots in the paper.

Commenting the code is work in progress; meanwhile feel free to contact me (mail Kristina Ganzinger (ganzinger AT biochem DOT mpg DOT de) or get in touch by [raising an issue](https://github.com/kganzinger/Analysis-Software-for-Freeze-thaw-cycles-induce-content-exchange-between-cell-sized-lipid-vesicles/issues)!
